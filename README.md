# dotfiles

Version control of various dotfiles and other parts of my setup. Sparsely updated.

## aliases

### git

List of git aliases in `.aliases` might seem short, but that's because it only list specializations. Since I'm using `oh-my-zsh`, the bulk of the aliases are located here in the respective [git plugin](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/git).
